                    <p>In our growing world, technology is the basis for all of our successes. Looking around, everybody and everything uses some form of technology. In order to make the world better, I, Krithik Tamilvanan, dream to be involved too. From a young age, I have been deeply interested in coding and the world of computer science. With the encouragement of my family, friends, and teachers, I pursued computer science as not only a career but also a dream. Computer science lets me express myself through projects for many causes. Whether it is helping patients or driving cars, computer science always has a key role. In addition, biology is a key concept in life everywhere, and it is greatly important to study and improve the biology of all organisms. Through biology, not only can humans understand ourselves better, we can understand all organisms, and change life for the better. Combining my interests, my goal is to become a Biotechnology Software Engineer, where I can implement my love of both computer science and biology to help make the world a better place. Utilizing my skills, I plan to major in computer science and biology, and use my knowledge to help change our world.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my life, I have earned many skills applicable to computer science and biology, such as dedication, cooperation, and leadership. From my experiences in coding, starting at block-based coding and transferring into text-based, I have learned that programming requires perseverance and dedication in order to overcome the hardest bugs and the toughest errors. Without the dedication I have developed, I would be nowhere as successful and passionate about coding as I am today and instead would have given up a long time ago. I have also had the opportunity to work with hundreds of coders, going from my own parents and friends to people from all around the world I have met in hackathons. My ability to speak and communicate with others has been a key factor in all my successes. These interactions have also taught me who I am as a leader. I feel the most important qualities as a leader is a clear idea and the willingness to listen to others, both of which I have. From my experiences, I have come to understand myself a lot more. As mentioned before, I am a leader and not a follower. I like taking charge, but I will always listen to the ideas of others and be willing to learn. I am also very willing, as I love to try new things and take risks for greater rewards. Together, these small traits help me make a huge difference everywhere.</p>

                    <p>In my years of high school, I have developed a love for biology and computer science, as shown through my many achievements. Through my participation in Destination Imagination, a STEM-based extracurricular activity, I have incorporated my skills in many ways. For example, I have built and programmed a drone completely from scratch, through the use of motors, electronic speed controllers, wooden frames, and more components. This drone can be used to monitor wildlife, one of many examples showing my passion for both technology and biology. I have also created flowers that replicate the opening and closing of actual flowers. These flowers tilt towards the sun and can bloom and close as well. Furthermore, I have also participated in team sports, including baseball and basketball. These activities have taught me to value teamwork and trust my peers and teammates. Together, with the skills I have cultivated, I feel I can accomplish my dream and change the world. With the use of technology and biology, I plan to make our planet a better place.
