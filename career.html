                    <p>During my time in high school, I have gained work experience through paid jobs and volunteering services, such as Little League Umpiring and volunteering at a language school, as well as explored careers that interest me through multiple guest speaker talks, including those of Erika Bergman and Lakshmi. To begin with, let us spotlight the work experience I have accumulated throughout my years of high school. To begin with, I worked as a Little League Umpire throughout Freshman year, and part of Sophomore year as well. Here, I had to call quick plays using my instinct, communicate my calls to other umpires and coaches, and clearly explain my actions. This experience taught me many life skills that I used to this day. For example, as an umpire, I needed to arrive at games 30 minutes prior to their start. This helped me build punctuality, and showed my professionalism as I gave importance to my job and never arrived late. Furthermore, I also improved my communication skills. Not only did I work well with other umpires, my “teammates,” improving my role as both a leader and a well communicating teammate, but also with coaches, who did not always agree with my calls. Such scenarios helped me gain work experience, as I always stayed calm and explained my actions, and never let my temper get in the way. </p>

                    <p>My skills were further improved with my volunteering at California Tamil Academy, a language school. Here, I had to design and develop classwork for students, weekly lessons, assign homework, and grade assignments and assessments. Being a teacher to this day, I have greatly learned a lot from my experiences here. Not only did I further improve my communication skills, as I clearly explained assignments, lessons, and more to children, but I also improved my time management, as I kept the class on track and focused, making sure I properly executed  my lesson. I was extremely professional and punctual, and the experiences I have learned here show through today.</p>

                    <p>Adding on, I have also attended multiple guest speaker talks in order to help me explore multiple careers and open my mind to new perspectives. For example, I attended Lakshmi’s talk on her job at Amazon regarding security. Her talk greatly captivated me, and allowed me to explore a field I had never really considered prior to this. I once had a closed mindset, fixed on becoming a DevOps Engineer. However, Lakshmi’s talk allowed me to explore a new field, one of cybersecurity. She explained various elements in her field, including white hat hacking, and various new Amazon products, including Alexa, DeepLens, and more. She allowed me to truly open my mind and be ready for new career opportunities.</p>

                    <p>I have also attended Erika Bergman’s talk about her life as a submarine pilot. I had always been interested in Marine biology, and wanted to combine my interests in Computer Science into biology, another passion of mine. Ericka’s talk allowed me to gain a new perspective, as well as a better understanding of the life of a submarine pilot. She explained various projects and expeditions she had ventured on, places she had visited, and also data she had collected. In regards to the data she had collected, I was able to correlate that with COmputer Science, as many people work as Data Analysts, something I too could be, allowing me to focus on multiple passions as a career choice. Ericka’s explanations also allowed me to truly test and see what I enjoyed. It showed me that I truly loved Marine Biology, and also that I would love to work in a computer science field that utilized biology. Overall, my career choices and explorations allowed me to explore new possibilities and see what truly suits me and captures my interests.

                    <p>I also attended Lakshmi Hanspal’s talk in February, 2024. The guest speaker talked about the dangers of AI, and the use of cybersecurity to regulate these fields. Coming from the cybersecurity and AI field of Amazon, she discussed the real world application of her work, as well as the various lessons we have learned in class. Furthermore, she introduced us to the real impact of cybersecurity on various fields, and explained the huge impact cybersecurity has on various fields in everyday life and technology. Ms. Hanspal’s talk was very interesting and informative for me, because my only experience to cybersecurity as a career was from school. Seeing the various experiences she talked about truly sparked my interest and love for cybersecurity.
