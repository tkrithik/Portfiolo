                    <p>Water is a vital element to life, an element none of us should ever be denied. Despite your upbringing, your economic status, your location, and other aspects, clean water is a factor that everybody should be able to count on. And yet, that is not the case. The key to our survival is not an immediate availability or guarantee for everyone. Our team strove to fix the problem of contaminated water sources through water pollutant tests, specifically testing for nitrate. Nitrate is a polyatomic ion, known by the chemical formula NO⁻ ₃. Commonly found in fertilizers and explosives, nitrates can be found naturally in water sources such as rivers and lakes due to bacteria that release nitrates. However, an excess amount of nitrates can seriously injure one's health, such as affecting how blood carries oxygen or causing methemoglobinemia. This excess typically occurs as a result of runoffs from farms with heavy fertilizers, as well as poor man-made water sources. As a team, we couldn’t just sit there and watch as more and more people are harmed by this pollutant. While we can point fingers at farms and other sources of this contaminant, a stronger, wiser choice would be to truly take action against this and develop working solutions in an attempt to fight for what we believe should be guaranteed to everyone. By providing technology that can truly save and change lives, our team can make a difference in the world as well, thus leading to the development of a nitrate filtration and detection system. This system worked by using two chemicals, one acid and one powder, which would react and turn a shade of red in the presence of nitrate. It could then be filtered through the use of activated carbons. In this project, my specific role was to develop a website, both for marketing purposes, and safety reasons. The use of a website allowed us to reach customers across the world struggling from this problem, and gave us a way to quickly contact them. Whether it was for a new product update/feature, a safety warning, or allowing our product to reach new eyes, the website greatly aided us in reaching our customers. Furthermore, as team captain, my role extended to managing and enforcing deadlines, coming up with meeting times that addressed the needs of all team members, and ensuring that all work was properly completed. However, being a leader came with its own set of challenges. I had to sacrifice my time to find slots in my day that worked with the timings of my other team members. Furthermore, I had to have a punctual plan, constantly making sure that all work was turned in on time and that the team was on track to success. I also had to be a good friend to my team members, as times were not always easy. Many times, we were devastated with an error in our product, but by keeping my team members hopes and spirits high, we were able to overcome even the steepest mountains. Regarding my website, many times, my formatting would be askew, or my JS would not function as intended. Despite these bugs and errors, I grew to realise that computer science is a long journey that required patience to learn and succeed, which I ultimately showed, leading to my success. Overall, this project has not only helped me improve my HTML, CSS, and JS skills, seen through my well-oiled and functioning website, but also my teamwork and communication skills, which I found were necessary to lead my team to success.</p>

                    <p>The objective of this project was to create a product that fit the guidelines given by Collegeboard. This rubric included guidelines such as requiring a list that was used throughout the program, both by being appended to and accessed later. Furthermore, iteration and sequencing was necessary, along with a user input and function that produced multiple outputs. Finally, the product must be explained through a video and writeup. I set to approach these guidelines and limitations by designing and building a game that functioned through user input, taking inspiration from arcade style Whack-A-Mole games. Coding through Python, I utilised the Turtle module in order to be able to animate and display a well-oiled, working game for the user that not only looked appeaisng, but also function in regards to the provided guidelines. I created various functions, such as a function asking the user for their difficulty level, a function that processed a user’s mouse input when clicking moles, and a function that used a timer to constantly display moles on screen until time was up. However, this project was not all easy. Many times, I ran into errors and bugs that I couldn’t wrap my head around, stumping me. However, I learned to persevere, and to view my problem from a different approach. I used print statements to debug, and thought of new, creative ways to code a portion of my project to avoid errors. Furthermore, I also found it difficult to keep about the given guidelines at times. However, I used my planning skills to clearly map out a plan and stick to it, through the use of flowcharts and psuedocode. This allowed me to go in with a clear, precise plan and execute it using my abilities, ensuring that I did not waste time trying to come up with ideas on the spot. These skills not only helped me here, but also helped me later in life, from the simplest of tasks to the hardest of jobs, as perseverance and planning can make or break one’s dreams. Furthermore, I was also very punctual through the course of this project. I set deadlines, and utilised time given in class and free time outside of class to the best of my abilities. Despite this being part of a collegeboard test, I stayed calm under pressure, and ensured that my time and effort would go into developing a product worthy of top marks. In summary, the skills I learned through this project not only allowed me to strengthen my Python skills, as I dove deeper into new modules and designed various functions, but also my punctuality and work ethic skills, as I stayed focus and up to the task, making the best out of my given time to develop a well-designed product, seen through this video here.

                    <p><b>Type of Project:</b> Team Project</p><br>
                    <p>The objective of this project was to create an interactive escape room, themed around
COVID-19, where the user can “escape” by interacting with the program through
typed commands. However, this entire project must be done without the use of any
loops. My team and I addressed the client’s request, the project criteria, and created an
escape room using Replit, where the user had to both use their general knowledge and
factual skills, along with their computer science skills. The user of our game needed
to solve problems as simple as word searches, and as hard as converting binary to
ASCII. Our project, which outputted questions on Replit’s command line, was also
well-formatted, with clear dividers and spaces, in order to deliver the most optimal
game experience to the client and player. We also made our game more challenging by
presenting the user with only two lives, which decreased with each incorrect answer.
My role in this project mainly revolved around coding the actual project, along with a
little documentation. Using Replit, we used major aspects of
python, such as lists, modules, and functions, to deliver our game. For example, we
imported the random module, which helped us randomize the letters in a word search
problem we included, thus allowing us to make the game a little different each time for
the user. We also imported a time module, which showed the user the amount of time
they have been playing the game for. A major challenge in our path was the lack of
loops. However, after much thought, we solved this by calling back-to-back functions
in order to create the loop effect. We also shortened our code length by storing the
questions and answers in a list, which we called upon by incrementing the list index
variable each time the user solved a problem correctly. Through my role in this
project, I strengthened my skills in many areas of Python, some of which included lists
and dictionaries, function calls and parameters, and importing modules. I also
improved my documentation skills, by documenting every sprint. Our team also created a video presenting our solution. Overall, both my partner
and I were extremely happy about this project, as it was not only fun but also
beneficial to our skills. As a team, we worked extremely well together, and
communicated questions, ideas and problems. We always helped each other out, and
could all agree that our roles greatly mattered to this project. Click the button to learn more!</p>

                    <p><b>Duration:</b> Approximately 4 weeks (October 2020 - Mid November 2020)</p>
                    <p><b>Type of Project:</b> Team Project</p><br>
                    <p>The objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly app revolving around a
current news topic. This app either needed to be an interactive game, an interactive
story, or an interactive media page. My team and I addressed the client’s request, the
project criteria, and developed an interactive user story, which was themed around
the news topic of COVID-19. The user of our game needed to solve ethical and
choice-making problems, such as deciding whether to wear a mask when going
outside, or washing your food after you buy it. Using MIT App Inventor, we
developed our app to be as user-friendly as possible. We included levels, buttons, and
a matching color scheme to make our app look more appealing. Furthermore, we also
challenged the user by limiting their lives to 2. However, we also allowed one hint
per game for the user, in case they were unable to solve a problem. Our app
displayed a question, along with an image and 4 buttons, a yes button, a no button, a
hint button, and a quit button. Based on the user’s selection, our app decremented the
user’s life if they incorrectly answered the question or ended the game if they had no
lives left. It also displayed a hint or ended the game if the hint or quit button was
selected. However, if the user correctly answered the given question, the app
continued on to the next question until the user won, or lost their lives. My role in
this project mainly revolved around developing and coding the back-end features of
this app, such as storing data in databases, working with functions, and checking the
user’s input. At first, I was unsure on how to store variables I needed to use for all
questions, as global variables reset with each screen or question. But then, after
background research, I decided on using databases to store values. For example, in
order to store the user’s lives across multiple questions, I stored the number of lives
the user had in a database, thus allowing me to call upon it when needed. My partner
and I also documented our process. Although MIT App
Inventor was a block-based coding site, this project allowed me to grow and
strengthen my fundamentals in computer science. Through participating in this
project, I not only strengthened my skills in places such as global and local scopes,
lists, and functions, but I also learned new valuable skills, like storing values in
databases. This project also introduced me to documentation, allowing me to
improve my skills here. Our team also created a video presenting our solution.
Overall, both my partner and I were very happy about the way this project turned
out. We worked well together, and always helped each other out. As a whole, we all
could agree that our roles greatly mattered to the development of this project. Click the button to learn more!</p>
